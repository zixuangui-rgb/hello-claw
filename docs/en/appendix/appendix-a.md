# Appendix A: Learning Resources Compendium

The biggest challenge in learning OpenClaw isn't the technology itself — it's information overload. Search "OpenClaw tutorial" and you'll find hundreds of articles, dozens of videos, and countless GitHub repositories. Some say "up and running in 10 minutes," others say "takes a month." Some recommend local deployment, others suggest running in the cloud.

**The purpose of this resource compendium is simple**: to help you find the most valuable resources in the sea of information, learn in a sensible order, and avoid unnecessary detours.

> **Reading tip**: Resources are organized into 8 categories. Within each category, they are listed in **recommended priority order** — items listed first are most suitable for the majority of readers. Items marked with ⭐ are editor's picks.

### 6.5 Security Best Practices

| Resource | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|

### 6.6 Evaluation & Benchmarking

| Resource | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| ⭐ PinchBench | <https://pinchbench.com> | The first real-task benchmark designed specifically for OpenClaw-class agents, covering 5 dimensions: file operations, data processing, web search, creative output, and tool invocation |
| ClawBench | <https://clawbench.net> | Standardized agent evaluation platform with 210 tasks, 14 domains, 4 difficulty levels, supporting cross-framework comparison with OpenClaw and others |
| ClawWork | <https://github.com/HKUDS/ClawWork> | From HKUST HKUDS, an AI economic capability benchmark based on nanobot, with 220 real GDPVal occupational tasks spanning 44 departments — agents are self-financing |

> **Why do agents need their own benchmarks?** General model leaderboards (MMLU, HumanEval, etc.) fail to reflect model performance in real agent scenarios. Capabilities like tool selection, file management, multi-source information synthesis, and error recovery can only be measured through end-to-end evaluation. PinchBench has models execute tasks in an environment with the exact same tools and workspace as a real OpenClaw instance, producing more meaningful results.

## A Final Word

The biggest obstacle to learning OpenClaw isn't technical difficulty — it's information overload and lack of direction.

The goal of this resource compendium is to help you find the most valuable resources in the vast sea of information, learn in a sensible order, and avoid unnecessary detours. But remember: **no amount of tutorials beats building one real project yourself**.

Start with the simplest thing: have OpenClaw send you a weather report every morning. Once that works, try something more complex. Every small success brings you one step closer to the ultimate goal of your own AI assistant.

**Four pieces of advice**:

- Don't pursue perfection — just get it running first
- Don't go it alone — when you hit a problem, ask the community
- Don't just learn without applying — put every feature you learn to use in your actual work
- Don't be afraid of making mistakes — the worst that can happen with OpenClaw is a reinstall

Happy learning!
